## ðŸŽ‰ MVP Complete!

The app now has full voice and text input capabilities with real-time UI updates!

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on http://localhost:3001

### 4. Test Voice Recording
1. On the home screen, tap the microphone button
2. Allow microphone permissions when prompted
3. Speak naturally about your day, for example:

   - "I went for a 30 minute run this morning"
   - "I completed my meditation habit today"
   - "I ate 2 eggs and toast for breakfast, then did 20 pushups"

4. Tap the microphone button again to stop recording
5. Wait for the AI to process your voice note
6. You'll see a toast notification showing what was detected

SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## Mobile App Experience

For the best experience:
1. Use Chrome DevTools mobile view (iPhone 12 Pro recommended)
2. Or access from your actual mobile device on the same network
3. The UI is optimized for mobile with:
   - Bottom navigation
   - Large touch targets
   - Swipeable panels
   - Mobile-first design

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot connect to server"**
- Make sure backend is running on port 3001
- Check that frontend `.env` has `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api`

**"Microphone permission denied"**
- Click the lock icon in your browser's address bar
- Allow microphone permissions for localhost

**"No speech detected"**
- Speak clearly and ensure your microphone is working
- Try a longer recording (at least 2-3 seconds)
